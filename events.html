					<div class="textblock">Last year we explored downtown Oslo. This year, we explore the old industrial side of Oslo with a
						walk down Akerselva, from Nydalen. The meet-up point is by Torgbygget Brua <a
							href="http://https://maps.app.goo.gl/wm4baooxDzo2AZsq7">(link on google maps)</a> , right
						outside the metro station at 12:00.</div>
					<div class="textblock">From there we walk down along the scenic walkway by the river, stopping to look at the historical
						buildings along the way. At around 13:15 we will reach Mathallen <a
							href="http://https://mathallenoslo.no/en/">(website)</a> where we will stop for lunch.</div>
					<div class="textblock">The walk ends at Outland <a href="http://https://www.outland.no">(website)</a> pop culture store
						in Oslo centrum around 15:00.</div>
					<div class="textblock">This event is free, and open for all. Fursuits are welcome, but there is no fursuit support
						provided.</div>

				<div class="bread">
					<div class="textblock">The pre-party bowling event takes place the evening before the party at Lucky Bowl Veitvet <a
							href="http://https://luckybowl.no/oslo/">(webite)</a>. A fun night of strikes and gutters,
						perfect for getting to know new people before the big party.</div>
					<div class="textblock">Tickets for the bowling are purchased together with the party ticket and includes two rounds of
						bowling. Further rounds can be bought on site directly from the venue.</div>
					<div class="textblock">A simple changing room will be provided. Here you can put on your suit, store your luggage, and
						get some water. Note that the room does have small windows towards the lobby and hallway inside,
						so we can not offer complete privacy.</div>
					<div class="textblock">Food and drinks can be bought onsite, you are not allowed to bring your own.</div>

					<div class="textblock">Furries are a creative bunch that make a wide array of items. At Pawske Party some of them will
						be present to sell you furry related art, merchandise and other interesting things. Follow our

					<div class="textblock">The furwalk is one of the highlights of the party. We go for a stroll in the area around the
						venue to say hi to strangers and spread some joy. Last year we ended up on national news when we
						stumbled upon a camera crew. Who knows what will happen this year?</div>

					<div class="textblock">After a long night of partying, you probably need some rest and some good food. We will be
						setting up at Vippa Street Food <a href="http://https://www.vippa.no/">(website)</a> where you
						can chillax with us and enjoy food from a variety of stalls. DJ Tigris will be playing some
						relaxing beats to keep the party mood present.</div>
					<div class="textblock">The event is fursuit friendly, with Vippa offering us their spacious HC toilet for changing. It
						is a spacious venue and we will be sharing it with regular customers, so here you can really
						show off in front of the normies.</div>
					<div class="textblock">No ticket is required for this event, but you are expected to buy something from the venue.</div>
					<div class="textblock">You can not bring your own food and drink.</div>
